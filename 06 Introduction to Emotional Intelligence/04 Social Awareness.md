# Social Awareness
<strong class='blue'>Your ability to understand and respond to the needs of others</strong>

## <span class='green'>Empathy</span>
Our ability to sense other people's feelings and perspectives. Empathetic people take an active interest in someone else's concerns, are excellent listeners and are able to pick up on verbal and non-verbal queues. Others tend to gravitate toward empathetic people.
### Three Categories of Empathy
1. <span class='blue'>Cognitive</span>: helps us see things from another persons perspective.  "Walking around in someone else's shoes"
2. <span class='blue'>Personal Distress</span>: Feel another persons state of distress so much that you fall into their state.
3. <span class='blue'>Empathetic Concern</span>: Healthiest category and the one we should focus on. Recognize the emotional state of others, become in tune with their state and respond by feeling and showing the appropriate level of concern.
## <span class='green'>Organization Awareness</span>
Understanding the organization's values and key power relationships.  Our empathy turned towards the organization. This is being aware of the organization around you and the business processes that take place.
## <span class='green'>Service</span>
Your ability to anticipate, recognize and meet your customer's needs.
