### Accurate Self-assessment
Really listen to what people are telling you and self-assess based on feedback you get from others - directly and indirectly

### Self Confidence

Self-confidence is kind of like a muscle; the more you work it the stronger it gets. 
1. Do you do what is expected rather than what you believe is the right thing to do?
2. Do new situations make you uncomfortable?
3. Do you feel positive and energized about life?
4. Do you avoid the difficult?
5. Do you keep trying after others have stopped?
6. Do you achieve your personal and professional goals?
7. Do difficult situations make you feel hopeless and negative?
8. Do you associate wiht people who work hard but don't meet their goals?
9. Do you receive positive feedback?
10. If not successful at first, do you lose interest?
11. Do you reflect on lessons learned?
12. Do you believe that if you work hard, you will achieve your goals?
13. Are you in contact with similar people who are successful?
