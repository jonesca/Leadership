## Finding Your Message

* Discover your main message and it will be received
* Your message should instantly resonate

**TIP:** Apply the "mom" test: Is thetopic focused enough to be able to explain it (at a high level) to mom? - Dan Wahlin

* Have 1 "Most Important Message"

* Open with a **compelling question** to hook your audience... or bold statement (**"The Blam!**)... this should be a 5 second item in the abstract or introduction to the presentation.
* Follow up with **key concrete skills** such as mentioning compelling aspects, what will be compared, etc... don't dawdle... get the key parts out and move along.
* Finish with the **Takeaway**; what's in it for me? What am I getting out of this, what am I gaining

## Develop Your Story Arc

* **Middle** Retrace your steps
* **End** Resolve the story and the message
