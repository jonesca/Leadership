# Introduction to Leadership for Software Developers

## Practice makes perfect

* Spend 8+ hours a day doing software development
    * You'll become a really good developer
* Spend 8+ hours a day working with people
    * You'll become really good working with people

<p class='tip'>Each person learns how to effectively lead differently</p>

## A Matter of Style

* How much leadership is style vs. substance? What you do, vs. who you are?
* **Answer:** it's almost all what you do. You don't have to change who you are.

Having the nerve to take a stand, and having confidence that what you have to say is worthwhile, is just one of the things that leaders do.

## Philosophy

* It's not just what you know, it's how you look at it...

**_For Example:_**

When you have a problem to solve do you:

* prefer action - dive in and trust on iteration to reach the right solution?
* value design -= think before you code (act)?

## The Human OS

### How do we figure things out

90% of learning is technique; 10% is figuring it out.  This is the same for technical and people skills; 90% of the time things work the same way or as expected, and 10% of the time there is variation

* Search Google / Ask for Advice
* Read the Docs / Ask the individual
* Trial and error

### We have to learn to adapt to different OS's with computers and with humans

* Different CPU archictectures / Different goals & priorities
* Different OS & Platforme / Different values
* Different languages / Different personalities

<p class='quote'>The techniques and approaches you use to work with and understand machines and software are directly applicable to working with and understanding people!</p>

### Human Beings are NOT Rational

* **From the Dilbert Principle:** We are all idiots, at least some of the time.

<p class='quote'>Man is not a rational animal, he is a rationalizing animal -- Robert Heinlein</p>

If you assume people are not rational but are rationalizing...

* You have to deal with their reality
* You have to look beyond the response
* The response becomes just another data point
* It forces you to look for approaches beyond the intial argument (which isn't working because your logical argument is met with the same response over and over and over)

<p class='tip'>Effective leaders and managers use emotion as well as logic!</p>

* Emotional arguments DO impact business decisions
* Emotional arguments DO impact technical decisioins

## You Can't Control People

<p class='tip'>The only person you have any control over is yourself.  Only through your own actions can you influence others.</p>

* Blaming others is a waste of time
* Look at their reactions for ideas on changing your approach
* It's almost impossible to get completely stuck - there are always more things you can try - and sooner or later if you keep trying, you'll come up with something
    * Just like tracking down and fixing or finding a workaround for a nasty bug...

<p class='tip'>If You Can't Control Yourself, You Can't Lead Effectively</p>

* Self-control is an essential part of leadership and management
* This does not mean, never showing emotion
    * It means that showing emotion is a choice

## You Can't Fix People

* Help people overcome their weaknesses?
    * Only works if they want it and they do the required work. You can't do it for them.
* Trying to help people who don't want it is largely a waste of time and energy
* Look for ways to combine individual strengths

* If you want to change your interaction with someone, you must change the input
* If what you are doing isn't working, try something else

## Seek and you shall find

<p class='tip'>We tend to find what we look for</p>

* Look for the best in people... you'll be surrounded by great people
* Look for the worst in people... you'll be surrounded by people with flaws and problems
