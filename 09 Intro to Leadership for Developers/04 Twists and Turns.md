# Twists and Turns

## Giving Credit

<p class='tip'>Don't seek credit -- give credit</p>

## Questions aren't always Questions

Questions are:

* Used to obtain information (of course)
* A way to offer an opinion
* A form of attack
* A way to influence the conversation and direction
* A way to get someone to elaborate on a point

## Making Mistakes

<p class='tip'>Everyone makes mistakes. It's how you respond that matters!</p>

* Accept
* Fix things if possible
* Figure out who is impacted
* Announce & Apologize
* Move on

* **It take confidence to admit your mistakes**
    * Confidence is related to leadership - so admitting mistakes helpsyou be seen as a stronger leader - and sets a good example for others

When others make mistakes:

* Stay calm - the other person is likely panicking enough for both of you
* Offer to help if you can - It's a great way to gain an ally and maybe a friend

## Asking for Help

* It's better to succeed with help than fail without it
* It's often a good idea to ask for help even when we don't need it
    * Give others the opportunity to contribute (and gain ownership)
    * Give others the opportunity to learn
    * Share the fun - It's more fun to work with others on a project
    * If you are competent, asking for help will rarely backfire
    * Don't bother if you are just being lazy or are incompetent
