# Leadership Topics

* Keep your commitments
* If you want something done, find someone who is already busy... **corollary**: get busy. Busy people are busy because they do a good job and meet their deadlines.
* Don't overcommit **<span class='tip'>Underpromise and Overdeliver</span>**
* **_Never fake it_** - if you don't know something, admit and learn
* You can't be expert at everything
* Explain your reasoning - people may not care about your reasoning, but they'll recognize you are acting with some logic even if they disagree
* Ask questions - don't fake knowledge you don't have
* Before trying to solve a problem, make sure everyone agrees that there is a problem and on the true nature of the problem.

## Brainstorming

* The goal is to generate possible solutions
* The classic approach is to shout out ideas and write them down
    * No commenting or discussion regarding "shouted out" ideas
    * Even if an idea is indeed "stupid" it could lead someone else to a brilliant idea
* Collecting individual suggestions can also work (my experience indicates this isn't very effective only a few actually participate)
* Look for the second great idea.  After a great idea is found; table it and look for another - if no other ideas can be found you at least know you have looked for every possible idea/solution.  Now you have multiple ideas to evaluate.
* Will the solution solve the problem as defined
* Do you still have agreementon the problem and nature of the problem
* Define criteria for measuring results
* Schedule a date to review results

## Assertiveness

This is the preferred leadership style

* Stance - Straight
* Hold your ground
* Volume (moderate)
* Respond to attacks calmly - reasonable but firm
* Tone - steady

**Assertiveness**: A form of behavior characterized by a confident declaration or affirmation of a statement without need of proof; this affirms the person's rights or point of view without either aggressively threatening the rights of another (assuming a position of dominance) or submissevely permitting another to ignore or deny orn's rights or point of view

## Allies and Enemies

* If you agree with everyone, everyone will be your friend - and if you're a politician, you'll get their vote. Can you say pandering?
* If you take a stand, some people will disagree with you - it's an inevitable part of leadership
* **Allies**: those who will look for reasons to agree with you and help you
* **Enemies**: those who will look for reasons to disagree with you and get in your way
