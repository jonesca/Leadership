# Communication

**Words** however we use them are the most direct and obvious management tool we have

* Never assume that what you said is what someone else actually heard

## It's Your Responsibility

* Your job communicating is not complete until you have confirmed understanding
* What you say is **not** important -- it only matters what is heard / understood
* Learning how to speak well is important, only in that it increases the chance you will be understood

## Emotion Carries the Content

* Tell a story to connect with emotion and draw your audience in...
* Jokes and humor; but only if it fits
* Share or describe feelings
* Be passionate about what you are saying; if you care about what you are saying, that will come across

## Positve - Negative - Positive

* When you open with criticism, the natural reaction is to become defensive
* People who are defensive and preparing their response are not listening!
* It is more effective to open with a **positive** followed by the **_criticism_** then conclude with a **positive**
    * When we hear a compliment we listen
    * Starting with a compliment reduces the chance of defensive reaction
    * Closing with a compliment leaves the lines of communication open for the future
* Finding the compliment must be real and sincere (even if awkward)
* Keep practicing until it is automatic, then use it always
* You still probably won't look forward to confrontations; you won't run away either

## "I" Statements

Using I statements such as _I think_ or _I feel_ followed by a statement of let's talk about it or an invitation to explain how I might be wrong opens the conversation and invites agreement even if it is only that to agree to disagree...

## The Behavior is not the Person

Focus on the person not the behavior...

## Active Listening

It is equally important for you to understand what the other person is saying as it is for them to understand you.

<p class='tip'>Rephrase and Repeat = Clarification, Confirmation and Understanding</p>

* That means listening
* Active lisstening does not eliminate disagreements; it just helps make sure they are real disagreements and not just misunderstandings

## Permission to Speak Freely -- Sir

* Opens a "safe" communication channel
* Great opening for awkward conversations
* "would it be ok with you if I just speak openly and completely honestly?"
    * Curiosity alone will usually get a yes
    * They'll listen carefully
* Combine with positive-negative-positive if using this approach to give criticism
* Use for compliments too

## Embrace Challenges

* Disagreements and challenges are an inevitable part of leadership; don't be afraid of them
* Encourage challenges; they are good for you

### Why Challenges are Good

* You may learn something
* They involve communication
    * Passive and sullen silence does not help you
* They are a sign of respect and trust
    * Those who challenge you believe you have the potential to listen and understand
* They are a sign of engagement
    * People don't argue if they don't care

### How to Encourage Challenges

* Be explicit
    * "I want to hear what you have to say, even if, and especially if it disagrees with me"
* Listen to challenges
    * Use active listening
    * Be tolerant, they may not be as skillful at communicating as you are
* If it gets personal or too heated, change the venue
    * Move the discussion to a private office or continue over lunch

## Tone, Volume and Emotion

* Remember, emotion carries the message
    * Use a dull monotone to help people sleep
    * Vary tone, tempo and volume for effect
* If you care about what you are saying, much of this will happen naturally
* Be VERY careful when it comes to anger...

### Anger Management

![Anger Management](anger.jpg)
* **NEVER** let anger control you; express it only as a calculated choice
* If you are truly angry, walk away - reengage when you are in control
* Watch the reactions
    * Be prepared to tone it down quickly
    * Two angry people in a room is rarely productive

<p class='tip'>Emotion, in all it's forms, is an essential part of communication. Knowing when to remove emotion is an essentially part of leadership and management.</p>

## Focus

* **Focus=Being the focus of attention**
    * Are they paying attention to you, or to their tablet/phone/laptop
    * It's easier to tune out in a group than in 1:1 conversations
* **Try not to be boring**
    * If you're concise, engaged and passionate, people are less likely to tune out
* **Pass the focus**
    * Ask a question, or introduce the other person, then turn your attention to them "Jill, could you explain..."
* **Dealing with focus thieves**
    * Pull focus to the person interrupting
    * Make sure you aren't wasting their time
    * End the meeting
    * Avoid public humiliation
        * Unless you're a professional stand-up comedian and will never see the other person again

## Write it out

### Written communication is more effective than verbal

* Easier to review
* Offers time for considered response
* Easier to distringuish between emotional content and other content

### Particularly effective for communication channels that are otherwise closed

* Don't use it just to avoid conflict

### Do not write it unless you don't mind there being a public permanent record of what you wrote

* Sooner or later, anything can get out
