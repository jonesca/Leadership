# Within the Hierarchy

## Expectation and Trust

* People tend to live up to expectations
* If you trust people, they will tend to be trustworthy
* Set reasonable expectations

<p class='quote'>The balance between setting expectations, and monitoring - between trusting and verifying, is tricky. Don't expect to hit the perfect balance (or even know what that is)</p>

### Don't Expect Perfection

* Expect mistakes - be prepared to deal with them
* Don't wait for people to bring problems to you - keep an eye out and try to catch them early.
    * High expectations can make it harder for people to come to you with problems
* Make sure that it is safe for people to come to you with issues

## Meetings

* Everything you say should be worth hearing
* do not just repeat what has been said
* Do not discuss things better said directly to individuals
* Avoid prolonging the meeting unless necessary
* Be concise
