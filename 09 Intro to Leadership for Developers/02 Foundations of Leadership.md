# Foundations of Leadership

Don't Try to be Liked - Earn Respect

The single most important **leadership technique** is being the role model or setting the example

People model those around them...so intentionally model the behavior you want to see...

* If you are a good role model, you will earn respect, if not, you will lose respect
* If you earn respect, your role modeling will become more effective, which will earn you more respect!

**Role modeling is always "on"**

* In person
* Social networks
* Email
* At work
* Outside of work

We are each the center of our own universe...others can't tell what we are thinking or feeling.  It is important we clearly explain our decisions clearly.

## Explain Your Decisions

* Other won't jump to wrong conclusions
* Demonstrates that you aren't just being arbitrary
* Acknowledges other people's ideas
* Reduces resentment if you ignored other people's ideas
* Helps other provide a reality check
* Demonstrates respect
* Helps others learn
* Demonstraqtes confidence
* **Earns you Respect!**

<p class='tip'>Explaining yourself is one of the morst important and effective tools for your leadership bag of tricks</p>

## Two Principles for Understanding Others

* Most disagreements stem from  a failure  to communicate
* People are rarely malicious
    * They are, however, selfish,inconsiderate,lazy, self-cedntered, egotistical, conceited, etc...
    * Many tend to see things in the worst possible light

<p class='tip'>Whenever you find yourself upset with someone or thinking anything negative about them based on some action or lack of action take a moment to come up with some innocent possible reasons for what happened.</p>

If you want to know how someone feels about something, what their priorities are, etc... <span class='tip'>ASK THEM</span>

People like talking about themselves more than they like listening; try to do more listening than talking.

## Ownership and Territoriality

**Feeling ownership increases commitment**; people who feel ownership are "stakeholders"

* Embrace good ideas (even if you already had them yourself)
* Treat bad ideas with respect (don't make enemies)
    * Ask questions and explore the idea; hopefully, the idea will be withdrawn as more details are discussed
* Don't fall in love with your ideas

## Courage

**Courage** is the ability to do something even when you are afraid of it

* Taking a stand is scary
    * It invites judgment and disagreement
* Take a stand when it means something
    * Don't feel obligated to do so just because you can
* Embrace Failure
    * You'll fail sometimes; that's ok
    * Look at failures as opportunities to learn
* People aren't paying as much attention to you as you thing
* Most people will want you to  succeed
* It's ok to change your mind
