# Communications

## Verbal

### There are critical skills that you need to learn to communicate effectively in all situations

- Express yourself clearly
- Know your audience
- Pay attention and actively listen
- Ask effective questions
- Stay cool, calm and collected
- Remember it's not all about you

## Meetings

### Signs of a poorly-run meeting

- No agenda or goals
- Nobody in control
- People not paying attention
- Participants frustrated and thinking "this is a waste of time"

### In person meetings

- Stay calm, listen, ask questions

### Running a Meeting

- **Think:** is an in-person meeting really necessary? Would an email suffice?
- Send the agenda in advance to set expectations.
    - Plan the take-aways and goals
- Invite only those people who need to attend
- Ask people to close laptops and put phones away to encourage active listening
- Start within a few minutes of start time
- Stick to the agenda and control the meeting
    - Balance progress with getting people's views heard
- Make sure someone is taking notes
- Send a recap to all attendees

## Presentation Levels
