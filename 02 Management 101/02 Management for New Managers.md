        Decision <u>you</u> make have to be in the best interest of the company, strategy, direction, short and long-term goals, etc.
        This might seem at odds with personal relationships, especially the relationships you had before you had managerial responsibilities.
        Uninvited to personal celebrations (out of the office)? Or, invtied to more personal celebrations?

        Your new title might take you to meetings and settings that you weren't comfortable in or not invited to. What you say, when you say it, and how you 
        say it might carry more weight whan you are used to.  You become a spokesperson for your company because of your new official capacity.
        These new relationships could change when your title changes again (for better or worse).

        <p>
        Managers are not allowed to delay and procrastinate decision (very much). The more they do, the more likely they will have a change in responsibilities.
        Making hard decisions, with grace, compassion, maturity and wisdom will be the ultimate test of your management skillset.  Sometimes, those decisions are
        yours alone to make, and the consequences are yours to bear.

        <p>
            You are accountable for things that others aren't accountable for.  This includes results, deadlines, finances, team culture, hiring and firing, 
            delivering bad news, etc. Consulting with your team is key, but they might make recommendations based on their perspective, with their lever of 
            accountability, and not understand the whole picture that you have.
