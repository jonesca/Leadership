        <h3 class="green">Learn to Let Go</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>When you are accountable, this is HARD</li>
            <li>If you don't let go, you will never be free</li>
            <li>Letting go allows you to focus on the right things</li>
            <li>Letting go creates a culture in your team</li>
            <li>Letting go sets expectations</li>
            <li>Letting go spreads responsibility</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="green">Understand Your Own Duties</h3>
        <p>Allowing your team to do what they were hired to do allows you to fulfill your own role as a manager.  If you do work they should do, and neglect
        your managerial duties, you are undermining their capabilities and your own duties.  Don't stretch yourself too thin by taking on more than you should.
        Let your team prove themselves, and even grow.</p>

        <h3 class="green">Who Gets the Assignment</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Is it assigned to the most skilled team member?</li>
            <li>Or the person who most needs to do it (for growth)</li>
            <li>Is time a factor (Is there a deadline?)</li>
            <li>Is quality a factor (it always is...)</li>
            <li>Is it based on who wants it, who voluteers?</li>
            <li>What if they can't squeeze it in?</li>
            <li>Can they say no, or shift priorities/progects?</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="innerdivborder">
        <h3 class="green">Set Aside Time to Coach and Mentor</h3>
        <p>Ensure the delegate knows you are available to help him/her. This needs to be a clear expectation, defined up-front. You must set aside time for training
        and to check in on the progress of the assignment. Empower them with resources and authority to get the job done right. Think of yourself as the QA person
        on the assignment.</p>

    <div class="innerdivborder">
        <h3 class="green">Establish Clear Communication Expectations/Channels</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Include reporting expectations (frequency, detail)</li>
            <li>Define who to report to and who the customer is</li>
            <li>Make sure deliverables are clearly defined</li>
            <li>Establish milestones and deadlines</li>
            <li>Create check-in and update meetings to prevent unforseen problems</li>
            <li>"Delegate the objective, not the procedure"</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="innerdivborder">
        <h3 class="green">Recognize Success, Own Failures</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Praise your delegate <b>publicly</b> for success</li>
            <li>Mentor the delegate <b>privately</b> for failures</li>
            <li>Let the own the "wins" of the assignment</li>
            <li>Give recognition (feedback) regularly</li>
            <li>As the mentor, coach, and boss, take responsibility for project failures (don't throw them "under the bus")</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="innerdivborder">
        <h3 class="green">The Bottom Line is...</h3>
        <p> that <h2><b class="green">YOU</b></h2> alone are <h3><b class="green">completely accountable</b></h3> for the success or failure of the project.</p>
