<p>Managers are a dime a dozen, but <b>good managers are rare</b></p>

    <h1>Management Phrases</h1>
    <div class = "innerdivborder">
        <h2>Micromanagement</h2>
        <p>When you don't give your subordinates any freedom to do their job.  They feel suffocated and are taught to not make decisions,
        always seeking approval from the micromanager instead of risking making mistakes.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "innerdivborder">
        <h2>Management by Walking Around</h2>
        <p>The concept that the manager needs to get out of their office, even though bogged down with paperwork and meetings,
        and meander amongst their team asking questions and sometimes trying to be a fly on the wall.  Great for collecting information,
        but could be intimidating and distracting if, for example, you give "suggestions" too strongly</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "innerdivborder">
        <h2>Empowering</h2>
        <p>You give your subordinates any tool and authority they need to do their job.  They can ask for more resources, and you regularly
        back up their decisions and outcomes.  They feel supported by you and empowered to do what they were hired to do, without fear of discipline,
        overstepping political boundaries, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "innerdivborder">
        <h2>Hands-Off</h2>
        <p>You (or your predecessor) hired competent people...now get out of the way and let them do their jobs! You do your job, probably managing up,
        and expect your people to be competent and get the tools and resources they need to do their jobs.  This creates an extremely independent environment
        where everyone should be working towards the company direction.</p>
