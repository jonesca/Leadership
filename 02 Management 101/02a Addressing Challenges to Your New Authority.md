        <h3 class = "green">Being Liked vs. Approval vs. Respect</h3>
        
        <p><b><u>Liked</b></u> is whimsical, and can be influenced by decisions you make to please your subordinates, their mood,
        and perhaps even how much you appease ("pacify by acceeding to their demands") them.</P>
        
        <p><b><u>Approval</b></u>, similarly, might influence your decisions based on how you are going to be perceived.  Thing about politicians,
        who notoriously make choices hoping for approval, not necessarily for what is the right decision.  The concept of wanting to be 
        approved of takes power away from you, but you are still the one responsible for the decisions and direction.</P>
        
        <p><b><u>Respect</b></u> is different.  You do what is right for the company, and even the employees.  Sometimes it doesn't seem right, and
        sometimes it's not easy, but you do it with integrity and courage.  Perhaps your goal is to build a healthy company, culture, and work
        environment. Decisions you make might not seem to make sense of others, but when they see success, even if they don't like you, they'll
        have to respect your management and leadership.</P>
