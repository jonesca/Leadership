        <h3 class="green">What is Mentoring and Coaching</h3>
        <p>Definitions online that differentiate mentoring coaching are...interesting. The bottom line is that you are getting outside help.
        This can be to help with a specific issue <i>(communication, patience, etc...)</i>, or something you can't yet define <i>(perhaps 
        to expanding your vision, think and dream bigger, be more optimistic)</i>. Can be a formal or an informal relationship. Either way, 
        look to others for help.</p>

        <h3 class="green">Specialized Coaching/Mentoring</h3>
        <p>Sometimes the relationship is informal. You can be mentored by someone you read (book or articles), or learn from (podcasts, webinars). Consider these mini 
        mentoring sessions for help with very small, specific tasks or goals. Look for people who have the right specialties. Role play that you are them, and ask
        yourself question that you think they would ask you.</p>
