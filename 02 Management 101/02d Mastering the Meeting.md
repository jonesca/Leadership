        <h3 class="green">You Are the Boss</h3>
        <p>Meetings can suck the life out of individuals and teams. When you are in charge, what can you do to use meetings as a powerful tool, and not a detractor
        and distraction?</p>
        <h3 class="green">WHY are you having meetings?</h3>
        <p>"because that's what we've always done..."</p>

    <div class="innerdivborder">
        <h3 class="green">Define the Why?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Reporting and update?</li>
            <li>New assignments (what to work on)?</li>
            <li>Strategy (brainstorming)?</li>
            <li>Can't really define a reason (then cancel the meeting!)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="center"><b><u>Create the right environment! Based on the why.</u></b></h3>

        <h3 class="green">Don't Waste Time</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The idea of the agenda (list what you need to cover)</li>
            <li>Make assignments before the meeting (no surprises)</li>
            <li>Create culture of having people come prepared (read important documents before, etc.)</li>
            <li>Don't let people hijack your meeting ("let's talk about that outside of this meeting...")</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="innerdivborder">
        <h3 class="green">Stay Focused and On Task</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Stick to agenda items</li>
            <li>Allow for flexibility, if it makes sense</li>
            <li>Otherwise, write down topics to address outside of this meeting (be email or in the next meeting)</li>
            <li>Get main priorities resolved, assignments made</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="innerdivborder">
        <h3 class="green">Limit Length of Meetings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Depending on the type of the meeting, make sure you have enough time to do what you need, but you don't create a feeling of wasting time</li>
            <li>This is showing respect to your meeting attendees</li>
            <li>Some meetins will be long (multi-day), others will be short (5 - 10 minutes)</li>
            <li>REspect the time, and respect the people</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="green">Sitting, Standing, Walking</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Mark Zuckerberg: the walking interview</li>
            <li>Standing Meetings: you can't get overly comfortable, so you focus on what needs to be talked about so you can get back to work (and appreciate
            the comfortable office chair you have)</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="innerdivborder">
        <h3 class="green">Follow-up. Or, Don't Have Meetings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Follow-up keeps the purpose of the meeting alive</li>
            <li>People learn meetins aren't just a lot of wasteful talk</li>
            <li>Follow-up creates a culture of accountability</li>
            <li>Follow-up shows you want progress</li>
            <li>Lack of follow-up negates the meetings</li>
