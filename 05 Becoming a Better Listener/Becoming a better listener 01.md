# Becoming a better listener

- The biggest communication problem is we do not listen to <strong class="green">understand</strong>. <span class="agree">Good point</span>
- Too often we listen to <strong>reply</strong>
- Listening is a <em>skill</em>, and <strong class="green">skills can be improved</strong>
- When you improve your listening skills, you can help others listen to (not just hear) you better
- Listening is <strong class="red">not</strong> hearing... listening is understanding, connecting, educating, even "communicating"

## Listening Ideas
- Take notes
- Write down things that you learn + emotions / reactions
- Summarize what you learned in the end (chapter, clip, module, etc...)
- Comment on your emotions / reactions so you know why you felt that emotion
- Write down whether you agree or not, why and what you propose
- List your follow-up action items
- Put a measurable time on how long you will try a suggestion
- Describe what you learn to someone else.  You will learn more by teaching what you learn
- Write down objectives you have and what you hope to learn from a course, conference, meeting, etc...
  - What do you hope to learn?
  - What do you hope to resolve?

### The Goal: Deeper Understanding / Retention
