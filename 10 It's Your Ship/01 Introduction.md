# It's Your Ship

## Management Techniques from the Best Damn Ship in the Navy

**_Captain D. Michael Abrashoff_**, former commander, USS Benfold

## Introduction

The business community has to figure out how to help people grow. When employees leave their companies, 65 percent are actually leaving their managers. This indicates **leaders are failing**

## Take Command

**Page 13:** My organizing principle was simple:  The key to being a successful skipper is to see the ship trhough the eyes of the crew.  Only then can you find out what's really wrong and, in so doing, help the sailors empower themselves to fix it.

## Lead by Example

### Never Forget Your Effect on People

**Page 35:** Leaders need to understand how profoundly they affect people, how their optimism and pessimism are equally infectious, how directly they set the tone and spirit of everyone around them.  How many times have you gone into your bosses office and felt smaller?  For example, she is working on e-mail and doesn't even acknowledge your presence; or the boss is talking to your and keeps interrupting to pick up the phone, because the phone is more important than talking to you. Or worse yet, he belittles you or your efforts.

**Page 36:** As a manager, the one signal you need to steadily send to your people is how important they are to you. In fact, nothing is more importatnt to you. Realize your influence, and use it wisely.  Be there for your people. Find out who they are. Recognize the effects you have on them and how you can make them grow taller.

### Leaders Know how to be Held Accountable

**Page 38:** focus on making sure a mistake, incident, accident, etc... never happens again, rather than on finding someone to blame.

### Never Fail the _Washington Post_ Test

**Page 39:** If what I"m about to do appeared on the front page of the _Washington Post_ tomorrow, would I be proud or embarrassed?  If I knew I would be embarrassed, I would not do it.  If I'd be proud, I knew I was generally on the right track.

**Page 39:** The Sunday school standard is enough: Do the right thing.  Forget petty politics, don't worry about whether you're going to upset anyone or ruffle anyone's feathers; if it is the right thing to do, figure out a way to get past the egos, a way to get around the bureaucratic infighting, and then do it.

**Page 44:** Treat every encounter with every personas the most important thing at that moment

**Page 46:** Something happened in me as a result of those interviews. I came to respect my crew enormously.  No longer were they nameless bodies at which I barked orders.  I realized that they were just like me: They had hopes, dreams, loved ones, and they wanted to believe that what they were doing was important.  And they wanted to be treated with respect.
