<h3>Marshall Goldsmith</h3>
<b>Pioneer in Executive Coaching</b>
<b>Pioneer in 360 Feedback</b>

    <ul>
        <li>The same beliefs that leadd to our success can make it very difficult for us to change behavior.  ...it is even more difficult to change
        others' perception of our behavior</li>
        <li>The behavior of leaders needs to be reflective of the stated values of the corporation ...key executives need to 'go first' in modeling positive
        behavioral change</li>
        <li>Managers who receive feedback and engage in ongoing follow-up with co-workers will almost always achieve positive change in behavior ...and be seen
        as more effective leaders by their key stakeholders</li>
        <li>The key to success in executive coaching is <b>not</b> the coach... it is the people being coached and their key stakeholders</li>
        <li>Leadership development should provide tools that can be used in a positive, simple, focused and fast manner... complex theories of change will not 
        work in the 'real world' with over-extended executives</li>
        <li>Most executive education has historically been based upon an invalid assumption, "If they understand -- they will do." ...The basic challenge
        faced by managers is practicing their understanding of leadership</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>John Maxwell</h3>
    <b>21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership</b>
    <ol>
        <li><b>The Law of the Lid (1)</b> - Your leadership is like a lid or a ceiling on your organization.  Your ...business will not rise beyond the level your leadership allows.</li>
        <li><b>The Law of Process (3)</b> - Leadership is learned over time.  People skills, emotional strenth, vision, momentum, and 
        timing are all areas that can and should be learned.  Leaders are always learners.</li>
        <li><b>The Law of E.F. Hutton (5)</b> - When [Hutton] spoke, everyone listened. When real leaders speak, people automatically listen. 
        [in] any group you can identify the real leaders by looking for those who people listen to.</li>
        <li><b>The Law of Solid Ground (6)</b> - Trust is the foundation for all effective leadership.  When it comes to leadership, there are no shortcuts.  
        Building trust requires competence, connection and character.</li>       
        <li><b>The Law of Connection (10)</b> - You must touch the heart before you ask people to follow. Communicate on the level of emotion first to make a personal connection. 
        Telling stories is a good way to communicate and touch the heart of those you are trying to influence.</li>
        <li><b>The Law of Buy-In (14)</b> - People buy in to the leader first, then the vision.</li>

    <h3>Ken Blanchard</h3>
    <b>The One Minute Manager</b>
    <ol>
        <li><b>One Minute Goals</b> - Clear and direct goals... <b>The secret</b> is to agree, upfront, on the tasks that the employee is accountable for,
        and ensure that the manager and employee's views on what a good job looks like are aligned.</li>
        <li><b>One Minute Praisings</b> - The key to developing people will always be to concentrate on catching them doing something right instead of 
        something wrong... A key to success is to praise progress, even if it is only approximately right.</li>
        <li><b>One Minute Reprimands</b> - Tell them beforehand that you are going to let them know how they are doing... Make it about behavior (not the
        person); do this immediately; be specific; <u>end well</u>.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <b>Servant Leadership</b>
    <ol>
