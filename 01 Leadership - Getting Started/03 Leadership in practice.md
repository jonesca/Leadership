        "The most important thing about running a company is to remember ... what a company is.  A company is simply a group of people.
        As a leader of people, you have to be a great listener, a great motivator, very good at praising and looking for the best in people."

            <li>You don't learn to walk by following rules. You learn my doing, and by falling over</li>
            <li>Overcome you personal challenges by training yourself to focus and concentrate</li>
            <li>A business has to be involving, it has to be fun, and it has to exercise our creative instincts</li>
            <li>You must understand the art of delegation</li>
            <li>Create something your proud of</li>
            <li>"Screw it, let's do it" --- stop analyzing, stop stalling, let's just get this thing done!</li>

        <p>Data trumps everything.  Decision should be made based on the data first.  In the absence of data, judgement or instinct might be used. </p>
        <p>A team should be small enough that it can be fed by two pizzas... <i>two pizza team</i> concept.  Any larger and effective communication can't 
        happen...</p>
