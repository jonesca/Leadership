# Introduction to leadership
##What is Leadership?
- "Leadership is a process of social influence, which maximizes the efforts of others, towards the achievement of a goal" -Kevin Kruse

## Leader vs. Manager
- Leadership and management must go hand in hand. They are not the same thing. 
But they are necessarily linked, and complementary. Any effort to separate the two is likely to cause more problems than it solves
 - A leader can be a manager
 - A manager can be a leader

## Leadership Styles
- "There is no such thing as a born leader. Leaderhip is an acquired attrribute that begin
early in school and on the playground."
- "...overtime, a leader may find that their winning formula is not producting the results
it used to. New challenges require new leadership skills, behaviors, and ways of communicating."
- Leadership consists of 20% knowledge and 80% behavior
- "If you're leading well, you won't have just one leadereship style. You'll mix and match
to engage your team and meet your goals"
